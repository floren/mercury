# The Mercury Protocol

This repository contains the specification and reference implementations for the Mercury protocol.

The specification is defined in SPEC.

## Server

To run the server:

   go install github.com/floren/mercury/mercury-server@master
   mercury-server -file /tmp/hello.txt

## Client

To run the client:

   go install github.com/floren/mercury/mercury-client@master

The client will prompt for servers. By default, Mercury servers run on port 1958, but you can use multiple servers to serve multiple files:

   $ mercury-client 
   Mercury host (q to quit)> example.org:1958
   Welcome!
   
   Check out example.org:1959 for some other stuff.
   Mercury host (q to quit)> example.org:1959
   You found the secret message!
   Mercury host (q to quit)>
